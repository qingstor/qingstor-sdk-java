# Preparation

In order to be able to use qingstor-sdk, you need to apply for an [API key pair](https://console.qingcloud.com/access_keys/) in our console first, which contains an `access_key_id` and a `secret_access_key`.

`access_key_id` will be included as a parameter to be sent in each request; `secret_access_key' is responsible for generating the signature of the request, `secret_access_key' needs to be kept safely, please do not share it with people you do not trust.
